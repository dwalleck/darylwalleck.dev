I've had the unfortunate luck to be job hunting twice in the last year. Before
then, I had two long stints of 5 and 8 years at my previous employers, so
I had very little experience with modern coding interviews. I heard horror
stories about ridiculous sounding whiteboard interview questions, but I assumed
it was something that only the "elite" tech companies used. Worst case, I also
assumed I'd be able to deal with if I ran into those type of questions in an
interview. I was very wrong.

When I started looking for a new job 13 months ago, I assumed that my years of
experience would carry most of the weight and that if I could prove that I was
a reasonably intelligent developer who could pick up new technologies as needed
that the search would be short and that the worst part would be a few bouts of
pre-interview anxiety.

(*Narrator*: *He was wrong*)

What followed was a series of humbling, imposter syndrome-inducing interviews
that made me question my education, capabilities, and previous work experience.
I did not land a job quickly. I spent 4 months in a cycle of revisiting
everything I thought I knew about algorithms and cramming Leetcode with the hope
that eventually I would catch up enough to land a job that was at least
equivalent to the one I was leaving. After 4 stressful months, I stuck the
landing in my interviews with a company I had hoped would be my home for the
next few years. Unfortunately, COVID happened and I was laid off just six months
after I started. This time I didn't have the comfort of already having a job
while looking for a new one, so I threw myself into more Leetcoding with the
hope that my previous work would make this round of job hunting easier.

(*Narrator*: *He was still wrong*)

It's been nearly five months since I was laid off and my search continues. I've
gone deeply down the roads of depression, anxiety, and profound imposter
syndrome. To keep myself feeling somewhat connected the developer community, I
started watching live coding streams on Twitch. One day while grumbling about
the Leetcode interview culture, the streamer stopped to give me a bit of advice
handling whiteboarding interviews. It wasn't advice I hadn't heard before, but
this time I was listening and took the advice to heart. That changed everything.

## What is LeetCode?

For anyone not familiar with LeetCode, it's a site that has a list of 1500+
questions with varying levels of difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) with tags for
the type of problem and the companies that tend to ask each question. Each
question comes with a problem description, several examples of expected inputs
and outputs, and a pane for you to submit your code solution.

## How not to LeetCode

My initial approach was simple: filter the questions by the company I was
interviewing for and try to tackle as many problems as I could successfully,
with some hope that I might be asked the same questions. The questions often
required an approach that not obvious to me, so after an hour of being stumped
I would flip to the solution tab to have the "Ah ha!" moment of seeing the
explanation and try to internalize the solution by writing my own and submitting
it. This _felt_ like progress. I was solving problems and could usually
regurgitate the solution when I needed to. However, that wasn't leading to
consistent success in interviews unless I was asked a question I had already
worked through. It was only later when the streamer was giving me advice that
I realized the terrible mistake I was making: I was memorizing solutions and not
internalizing the algorithms and techniques needed to solve the problems. I
didn't see the connections between problems, so each question felt like I was
starting from step one. This is bad habit that I picked up in high school that
worked well then, but was crippling me now. I knew the algorithms used in the
problems, but it wasn't always obvious to me what approach would make sense
for the problem.

## Step 0: Creating a problem solving approach

As I was listening to the streamer explain how to handle whiteboard interviews,
I saw the first of many mistakes I had been making: *I didn't have a general
approach to solving problems*. I always asked questions to interviewers to
clarify problems, but the next step was always "solve the problem". I think this
is something I've always done. I was too focused on getting some kind of answer
out of my head to properly think about the problem.

The answer was a bit counter-intuitive: get out of my code editor and back to
pencil and paper. Ironically, this was how I was originally taught how to design
programs. One of my high school coding teachers required flowchart for our
problems before we were allowed into the computer lab. I had become so used to
opening an editor and banging my head on the keyboard until I reached a working
a solution that I stopped giving myself the time to think and plan.

My new approach is straightforward:

    - re-state the problem
    - If there are specific cases or rules about the problem, create a bullet
      that lists the cases and their outcome
    - Start listing test cases and their expected outcomes
    - Write the pseudocode that would make the test cases give their expected
      outcomes

The last step may sound line a "Step 2: ??? Step 3: Profit!" or "draw the owl"
statement, but it builds on the information we stated in the rules and test
cases. There's likely some low hanging fruit that we discovered in the test
cases or problem definition that we can start our pseudocode with.

## Step 1 - Seeing the patterns

There's a critical problem with rote memorization: it requires no imagination.
If you can jam the information in your brain and recall it, you can dump it
back out again. However, is that really learning? I knew I was on the right path
when I started connecting the dotted lines between problems and recognizing
that I was dealing with a graph, tree, or other foundational algorithms problem.
At this point the problem is far from solved, but you have an 


you are not your code
your ability to code well != your worth
I had been a valued, high performing developer up until then. Was that a lie, or
had I been working in a small, perfect niche that allowed me to excel?
Giving an answer isn't as important as showing how you got there

## I hate LeetCode

## ...but LeetCode might help you with problem solving

It's not that I couldn't solve problems; It was that I had a bad approach to solving problems
Being a competent coder does not necessarily make you a good problem solver.
That was a painful admission I had to make to myself. The important thing to
remember is that the inverse is not true: *not being an expert problem solver does not make you a bad developer*.
We all have

What you can take away from Leetcode
- Creating an approach for dealing with problems you an unfamiliar with
- See patterns in problems (bridging Algorithms with actual problems)
- Practice to help deal with interview jitters
- You don't always have to get a problem right in an interview to pass. Problem
  solving > memorized answers

What *not* to take away from Leetcode
- Specific answers to problems without understanding the solution



I hate to give the answer, but _it depends_ is the best answer I can give. Not
all companies
